status: **alpha**

### Goals
- Speed
- Security

### Ideas
- Rust interoperability
- Ability to import externals files
- std library
- Low-level (networking, file system...) APIs

### Example

```rust

fn calc(value){
    if value == 5 {
        return 0
    }
    value.mut_sum(1)
    println(format("Value is {}", value))
    return calc(value)
}

let _ = calc(0)
```

There are more examples in /examples.
