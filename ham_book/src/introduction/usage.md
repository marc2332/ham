Ham's interpreter has a built-in [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)

Open a terminal and type:
```shell
ham repl
```

You can also run standalone files:
Run files:
```shell
ham run examples/demo.ham
```

Or simply run a project (This will run `1_project/src/main.ham` automatically):
```shell
ham run examples/1_project
```
